Uninstalling TNA
================

TNA stores files in a data folder somewhere inside your home folder.
Its location depends on your operating system.
Open TNA, and then in settings use the
"Open TNA data folder" to open the folder in your file browser.

Close TNA, and then delete the TNA data folder. This has cleared all files
that TNA made. If you were to restart TNA, then the folder will be recreated.

Once the data folder is deleted, delete the TNA app itself, in other words
the .exe file on Windows, .app on macOS, or the executable file on Linux.
