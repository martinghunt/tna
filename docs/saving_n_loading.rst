Saving and Loading
==================

Once genomes have been imported and BLAST has been run, the entire project
can be saved, via the "Save" button in the main menu. It saves the current
state of the contigs, so if they have been re-ordered or reverse complemented
then that is what is saved, not the original state of the genomes.

Ziplign saves both genomes and the blast matches inside a single file that it
can then load, via the "Load" button in the main menu. The file format is
specific to Ziplign and will not work with other applications.
