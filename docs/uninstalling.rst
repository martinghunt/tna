Uninstalling Ziplign
====================

Ziplign stores files in a data folder somewhere inside your home folder.
Its location depends on your operating system.
Open Ziplign, and then in settings use the
"Open Ziplign data folder" to open the folder in your file browser.

Close Ziplign, and then delete the Ziplign data folder. This has cleared all files
that Ziplign made. If you were to restart Ziplign, then the folder will be recreated.

Once the data folder is deleted, delete the Ziplign app itself, in other words
the .exe file on Windows, .app on macOS, or the executable file on Linux.
