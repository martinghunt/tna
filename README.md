# Ziplign

Ziplign is a free application to visualise the comparison of two bacterial genomes.
It is intended to be easy to use: you just need to drag and drop two sequence
files to compare. Ziplign will run BLAST for you and show you the results.
There is no need to use a terminal or type any commands.
