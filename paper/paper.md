# Summary
TNA is a user-friendly interactive application to visually compare two
bacterial genome sequences and their annotation. It requires no command-line
use, and is intended to make genome-comparison easily accessible to the
biologist. Genome files can be directly drag-and-dropped into TNA, or will be
automatically downloaded when an accession is provided. All commonly-used file
formats and compression are supported. The comparison between genomes is
generated using NCBI blast+[@blast], which is run for the user, and then the
two genomes, their annotation, and sequence matches are displayed by TNA. A
screenshot of TNA is shown in \autoref{fig1}.

coli K-12 substr. MG1655 GCF\_000005845.2 [@k12] - shown at the bottom.
BLAST matches are shown in red when the direction of
the match is the same in both genomes, and in blue when they are in opposite
directions. To reduce noise in the screenshot, only matches of at least 2000bp
and 95% identity are shown (configurable by the user via the panel on the
left). Annotation features on the forward/reverse strand are shown in the
top/bottom of each contig. a) Default view, showing the complete genomes and
their overall structural similarities. b) Zoomed to the base-pair level,

# Statement of need
Comparing two bacterial genome sequences is a fundamental task in genomics,
used in numerous scenarios: comparing closely related strains to discern
differences such as the overall structure and any rearrangements, the presence
or absence of important features such as virulence factors or anti-microbial
genes, or to identify horizontal gene transfer. Genome assemblies can be
compared to each other or against a reference genome for debugging or
determining the most accurate assembly. Whilst many command line tools are
available for processing samples at scale and report statistics, it is
invaluable to visually and interactively compare two genomes. This is often
the simplest way to truly understand the differences between two
sequences.

To our knowledge ACT[@act] and Mauve[@mauve] are the only existing tools
for displaying genomes and matches between them in an interactive manner -
however both tools are no longer supported. Since ACT is based on
Artemis[@artemis], it incorporates the extensive feature set implemented in
Artemis. However, ACT has a number of limitations. It can be difficult for
non-technical users to install and use, Java must be installed, the user must
provide (most likely via running command line tools) a genome comparison file,
multi-sequence genomes are not supported out of the box, and alignment details
including SNPs and small insertions/deletions are not shown. Mauve is simple
to run but it only shows unique synteny/collinear blocks between genomes,
meaning that repeats may not be shown. We tested this using a single contig
1000bp genome compared to a genome comprising two copies of the same contig,
where Mauve showed no matches (also tested again using a 10,000bp contig).

Here we introduce TNA, which fills the need for an easy-to-install and
simple-to-use genome comparison tool. It is heavily inspired by ACT, with a
very similar user interface, but is significantly easier to install and
use.


# Usage and availability
TNA is intended for microbiologists with no command line experience. As such,
no use of a terminal is required. First, two genomes must be provided, either
with an NCBI accession or by dragging-and-dropping local files. FASTA, FASTQ,
GFF3, EMBL and GenBank file formats are supported, optionally with gzip, bzip2
or xz compression. Genome sequences and annotation are automatically
downloaded when an accession is used. TNA runs blastn from the NCBI blast+
suite to generate the matches between the two genomes. The blastn
options are configurable by the user.

Genomes are displayed at the top and bottom of the window, with BLAST matches
shown between them (Figure 1). The view can be zoomed and panned using mouse,
trackpad or keyboard controls, or with buttons in the control panel on the
left. Features include searching by nucleotide sequence or annotation, contig
reordering, and reverse complementing contigs. TNA can save and load an entire
“project” - the genomes, annotations, and BLAST matches - using a single binary
file, removing the need to store the original files.

TNA is available for Windows 11, macOS, and Linux operating systems from
GitHub [https://github.com/martinghunt/tna](https://github.com/martinghunt/tna),
under the MIT license.
Comprehensive documentation is hosted on ReadTheDocs
[https://tna.readthedocs.io/en/](https://tna.readthedocs.io/en/).


# Implementation
TNA is primarily written in GDScript, the scripting language of the free, open
source, MIT licensed, game engine Godot
([https://godotengine.org](https://godotengine.org),
[https://github.com/godotengine/godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot)).
This handles the graphical user
interface (GUI), and displaying and interacting with all the genome and
comparison data. Bioinformatics tasks such as parsing sequence/BLAST files and
downloading genomes are processed using a separate command line program called
tnahelper
[https://github.com/martinghunt/tnahelper](https://github.com/martinghunt/tnahelper),
also with the MIT license, written in the Go programming language. All command
line programs are hidden from the user, so that the only interaction is simply
with the GUI.
